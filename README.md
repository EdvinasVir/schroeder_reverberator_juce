# schroeder_reverberator
This is a schroeder reverberator vst3 plugin created using JUCE framework. The plugin includes a UI created using WYSIWYG editor and reverb engine consisting of all-pass and comb filters that I have coded myself. 

Known bugs: 
1. 'Clear' does not clear buffer properly
2. After loading a plugin, a quick 'pop' can be heard
